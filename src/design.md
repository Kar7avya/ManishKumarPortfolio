# Executive Portfolio Website – Design Brief

Design a high-end, executive-level personal portfolio website for a senior industrial leader with over 30 years of experience across power generation, oil & gas, fertilizers, and large-scale infrastructure operations.

## Objective
The website must immediately communicate credibility, authority, and leadership.  
This is not a creative or student portfolio. It should feel appropriate for CXOs, board members, enterprise recruiters, and global energy organizations.

## Target Audience
- Power & energy sector executives  
- Infrastructure and EPC leadership  
- Enterprise recruiters for AVP / VP / Director roles  
- Strategic partners and consultants  

## Brand Positioning

- Sophisticated and premium, not flashy  
- Industrial, strategic, trust-driven  
- Focus on scale, responsibility, and long-term impact  

## Visual Style
- Dark executive color palette (deep blue, slate, charcoal)  
- Subtle gradients only where they enhance hierarchy  
- Minimal animation, smooth and professional  
- Glassmorphism used sparingly for premium sections  
- Large typography with clear hierarchy and generous spacing  
- Mobile-first, desktop-optimized for executive viewing
